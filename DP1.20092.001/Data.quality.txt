Data on conditions during sampling can be found in the gwc_fieldSuperParent table, including water depth in the wells, sampling methodology, and volume of water purged. The gwc_wellStabilization table provides data about stabilization of water in the well associated with sampling. The sampleCondition field in the gwc_externalLabDataByAnalyte table provides information about the condition of the sample at the time of analysis. The swc_externalLabSummaryData table provides data about long-term performance of the analytical laboratory, including method detection limits, precision, and uncertainty.

Note that values can be blank (or NA when downloaded using neonUtilities) for analyteConcentration for a few different reasons. Users are encouraged to look at entries in sampleCondition and belowDetectionQF for details on the reason for a particular record. Records with entries other than "GOOD" or "OK" in sampleCondition likely indicate that data for a given analyte were not collected and users cannot infer a value for the analyte to include in their analysis. For records with "ND" values for belowDetectionQF, users can infer that the analyte concentration is very low and may want to include the records in their analysis.

Given the potential for additional uncertainty arising from sample collection/processing, shipping, and storage time prior to analysis, we strongly recommend using the in-situ Water quality (DP1.20288.001) sensor data whenever possible, particularly for specificConductance and pH. Alternatively, users may use the field measurements of specificConductance and pH included in the swc_fieldSuperParent table, which are measured at the time of sample collection. Alkalinity and ANC titrations are typically performed within 24 hours of sample collection and the initialSamplepH found in the swc_domainLabData expanded package is another option for users when other data is not available. Measurements in the swc_externalLabDataByAnalyte table have the longest time between sample collection and measurement and may not reflect conditions in the stream as closely as the above mentioned measurements. When comparing water chemistry grab samples to sensor-based water quality data (DP1.20288.001), note that water chemistry samples are collected at the downstream sensor set (horizontalPosition 102 or 112) in streams and at the buoy location (horizontalPosition 103) in rivers and lakes. Because of lower uncertainty, we encourage the use of continuous sensor data whenever possible.
