Data on conditions during sampling can be found in the gwc_fieldSuperParent table, including water depth in the wells, sampling methodology, and volume of water purged. The gwc_wellStabilization table provides data about stabilization of water in the well associated with sampling. The sampleCondition field in the gwc_externalLabDataByAnalyte table provides information about the condition of the sample at the time of analysis. The swc_externalLabSummaryData table provides data about long-term performance of the analytical laboratory, including method detection limits, precision, and uncertainty.

Note that values can be blank (or NA when downloaded using neonUtilities) for analyteConcentration for a few different reasons. Users are encouraged to look at entries in sampleCondition and belowDetectionQF for details on the reason for a particular record. Records with entries other than "GOOD" or "OK" in sampleCondition likely indicate that data for a given analyte were not collected and users cannot infer a value for the analyte to include in their analysis. For records with "ND" values for belowDetectionQF, users can infer that the analyte concentration is very low and may want to include the records in their analysis.
