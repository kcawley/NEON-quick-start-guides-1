Point counts at all sites are conducted by local contracted experts. At larger sites, point counts occur once per breeding season at 5-15 nine point grids with the grid centers colocated with the center of Distributed Base Plots. At smaller sites (cannot accommodate the minimum of 5 grids) point counts will be conducted from the southwest corner (point 21) of 5-25 Distributed Base Plots, twice per breeding season. All point counts are six minutes long. The observer detects birds through visual (binoculars and laser rangefinder), auditory (singing or drumming), flyover, or other aural (e.g. wing beats) means.
