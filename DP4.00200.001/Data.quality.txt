Each sub-data product value is accompanied by a final quality flag (qfFinl) under the quality flag quality metric (qfqm) section of the HDF5 file (see HDF5 file structure image for its location). NEON recommends only using data where the corresponding final quality flag is 0. Data with a final quality flag of 1 are potentially erroneous and should be used with caution. The final quality flag is based on automated QA/QC tests, including range, step, and spike tests, as well as a manually set science review flag if applicable following Smith et al. (2014). Each sub-data product is accompanied by an estimate of measurement uncertainty under the uncertainty (ucrt) section of the HDF5 file (see HDF5 file structure image for its location).

Monthly basic files contain summarized quality flags derived from multiple quality metrics and quality indicators assessed during data processing. Detailed quality information is presented in the daily expanded files. Before including any data with a final quality flag of 1, we encourage users to review information in the expanded files to determine why the final quality flag was raised.
