Information on site events, planned and unplanned, are gathered through direct observation by NEON staff during scheduled site visits, and through secondary reporting by site hosts, landowners, or other reliable sources. Reporting occurs for all sites and all data-generating systems (TIS, TOS, AIS, AOS, AOP) affected by events.
