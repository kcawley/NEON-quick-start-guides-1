The identificationQualifier field indicates uncertainty in taxonomic identification, and the taxonRank field indicates the specificity of the identification. For individuals monitored via dendrometer bands, the dendrometerCondition field indicates any problems with the band at the time of data collection.

For analyses that rely on precise geolocation of individuals, the coordinateUncertainty field in the vst_mappingandtagging table contains the uncertainty at the plot level; ie, it reflects that each measurement was made somewhere within the plot. To calculate the location and uncertainty for each mapped individual, follow the instructions in the User Guide, or use the geoNEON R package to perform the calculations. https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-geolocation
