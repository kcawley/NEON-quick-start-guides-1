Fine root biomass may be expressed either on an area basis (e.g., g/m^2) or as fine root density (g/cm^3 or kg/m^3 soil). For either approach, one must first calculate the mass of fine roots across all size categories within a sampleID (i.e., using data in the bbc_rootmass table), and then add the mass of fine root fragments captured via dilution sampling that are not sorted to size category (i.e., using data in the bbc_dilution table). Total fine root mass from the sample can then be scaled to a per unit area basis, or a per unit soil volume basis.

Using the bbc_rootmass table, fine root biomass across size categories for roots > 1 cm length may be calculated by grouping and summing by sampleID. However, first one must decide how to deal with QA records in the bbc_massdata table where different technicians independently weigh a subset of the samples in order to quantify measurement error. These 'QA' samples, identified via qaDryMass=="Y", may either be removed or averaged before proceeding. Once a decision is made about QA samples, the next step is to keep only those records with samplingImpractical == NA or 'OK'. Finally, calculate the fine root biomass across size categories (i.e., sumSizeCatDryMass) within each sampleID as the sum of the masses of all size categories.

Note: If one is interested in fine root biomass within size categories, prior to May 2019 the following categories were employed: 0-0.5 mm, 0.5-1 mm, 1-2 mm, and 2-10 mm; after May 2019, the 0-0.5 mm and 0.5-1 mm categories were combined into a single 0-1 mm size category. In addition, after May 2019 roots were no longer sorted by rootStatus into live/dead pools.

Using the bbc_dilution table, the next step is to calculate the mass of fine root fragments <= 1 cm length, then add this fragment mass to the mass already calculated across size categories from the bbc_rootmass table. In the bbc_dilution table, up to n=10 dilutionSubsampleID replicates are created per sampleID in order to quantify the biomass of fine root fragments < 1 cm length within the sampleID. First, the fragment dry mass is calculated for each dilutionSubsampleID replicate:

fragmentSubsampleDryMass = dryMass * (sampleVolume/dilutionSubsampleVolume)

Then, group the data by sampleID and calculate the fragmentDryMass for the sampleID as the mean of the replicate fragmentSubsampleDryMass values. Next, use the sampleID to join the fragmentDryMass values to the sumSizeCatDryMass values by sampleID and then sum sumSizeCatDryMass and fragmentDryMass values for total mass for each sampleID. 

Once the fine root mass calculated from the bbc_rootmass and bbc_dilution tables have been summed for each sampleID, the last step is to join with bbc_percore data in order to scale to either root mass per unit area or root mass density. Once again, join the calculated total fine root biomass to the bbc_percore table using the sampleID, and then utilize 'rootSampleArea' and 'rootSampleDepth' columns as needed in order to appropriately scale the root mass data. Note that 'rootSampleArea' is reported in m^2 and 'rootSampleDepth' is reported in centimeters.
