Discrimination between live and dead root biomass via visual sorting contained too much uncertainty, so after 2019-05-06, all biomass has rootStatus = 'mixed'.  Additionally, size classes 0-0.5 mm and 0.5-1 mm were combined to reduce labor; a 1 mm cutoff still yields valuable information about absorptive vs. transport roots.

The sampleCondition field in the bbc_percore table describes the condition of the sample at the time of collection. A subset of samples are weighed and/or analyzed in replicate as a quality assurance check; these are indicated by the qaDryMass field in the bbc_rootmass table and the analyticalRepNumber field in the bbc_rootChemistry table. The bbc_rootChemistry table also includes quality flags applied by the analytical laboratory during processing; these are the fields ending in QF. The bgc_CNiso_externalSummary table contains the lab's ongoing quality control data, including the results of standard samples run as unknowns.
