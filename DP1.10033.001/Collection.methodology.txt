Litter is collected in elevated 0.5m^2 mesh traps; fine woody debris is collected in 0.5x3m ground traps in the tower airshed. Sites deploy either 1 or 2 pairs of elevated and ground traps at plots with qualifying vegetation. Samples from elevated traps are collected up to 13 times a year, schedule determined by local phenology. Ground traps are collected once per year. Field samples are sorted to functional group, dried, and weighed to the nearest 0.01g (samples <0.01 g recorded as 0.005g). Once every 5 years, subsamples from one bout per functional group are further processed by an external lab for C, N, 13C, 15N, and lignin.
