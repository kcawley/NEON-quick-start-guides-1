Samples are collected only from wadeable streams during periods of stable stream flow and are collected 3 times a year at the same time and location as algal periphyton. Samples are collected using the most appropriate sampler based on the substratum. After collection, samples are frozen in the field on dry ice, and transported to ultra-low temperature freezers at the NEON field laboratory. Samples are then shipped to a laboratory for DNA extraction and sequencing.
