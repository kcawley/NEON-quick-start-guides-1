Assessing the quality of digital hemispherical photos (DHPs) involves inspecting images for sharp focus, masking out large tree boles close to the camera lens that may inflate estimates of Plant Area Index, and for downward-facing images, masking out the photographer's legs and feet. Image focus may be assessed manually or programmatically (e.g., using Python OpenCV or equivalent). To ensure that DHPs have a high likelihood of being in focus, the protocol requires an f/stop ≥ 4 and that the shutter remain open for no longer than 1/30 s. However, it is possible that DHPs that do not meet protocol requirements are nonetheless available for download; it is therefore recommended that data end-users evaluate image f/stop and shutter-speed programmatically (e.g., using the free ExifTool software) as a quick first-pass to identify images that may be out-of-focus.
