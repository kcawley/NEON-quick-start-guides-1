Latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (m) of the soil plot reference corner are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Sensor depths are not currently reported correctly in the sensor_positions file, see swc_depths and readme_swc_depths files for installation depths. Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name  (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. HOR indices 001-005 correspond to soil plots 1-5, and VER indices 501-508 increase with increasing depth.
