Each measurement is accompanied by a final quality flag (VSWCFinalQF and VSICFinalQF). The final quality flag for soil water content data is raised (i.e., VSWCFinalQF = 1) when it is calculated using the sensor manufacturer’s default calibration rather than a soil-specific calibration. However, for many use cases the default calibration is sufficient. To identify data that were solely flagged because they were generated using the default calibration, download the “Expanded” data package and identify rows where VSWCFinalQF = 1, VSWCAlphaQM < 10, VSWCBetaQM < 20, (VSWCFinalQFSciRvw = 0 or NA), and tempFailQM = 0. Each measurement is accompanied by an estimate of measurement uncertainty, expressed at the 95% confidence level (VSWCExpUncert and VSICExpUncert), which comprises known and quantifiable uncertainties.
