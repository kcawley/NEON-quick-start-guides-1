Foliar sampling is conducted every 5 years, during peak greenness. Individual leaf samples are collected from forest and shrubland vegetation, while grasslands are sampled by clipping a full strip of vegetation, similar to the Herbaceous clip harvest (DP1.10023.001) protocol. For woody vegetation, the most abundant species are targeted for sampling; the goal is to provide data for the major canopy species, to facilitate analyses that connect ground sampling to remotely sensed measurements. Georeferencing is accomplished using mapping and tagging, as done in Vegetation structure (DP1.10098.001). In addition, shapefiles delineating the outlines of sampled woody individuals are available for some sites and will be generated for other sites on a rolling basis.
