In the rea_fieldData table the quality flag incompleteExperimentQF is used to indicate that the reaeration experiment was incomplete in some way. In the rea_backgroundFieldSaltData_in and rea_plateauSampleFieldData_in tables the incompleteExperimentQF quality flag is used to indicate that external lab data will not be returned for one or more samples in the specific record. The expanded data package for this data product includes external lab metadata files (rea_externalLabDataGas and rea_externalLabDataSalt) with quality flags for gas and tracer sample analysis, and a summary file (sdg_externalLabSummaryData) of the external facilities method detection limits, precision, and uncertainty for each analyte.
